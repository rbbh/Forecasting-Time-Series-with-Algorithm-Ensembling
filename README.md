# SVR-PSO
This repository aims to combine two Machine Learning techniques, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), in order to optimize the forecasting of time series. The PSO is used to find the SVR's best hyperparameters (C, Epsilon and Gamma) that minimize the Error of the prediction done by the SVR.
